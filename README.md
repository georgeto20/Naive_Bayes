This repo contains the notebook for the Naive Bayes model in my Applied Machine Learning course.

The data_5 folder contains training, validation, and test files for tweets containing any one of 5 emojis, and data_20 contains the same for 20 emojis. The human_test.txt file contains human-annotated tweets, with each tweet corresponding to an emoji.
